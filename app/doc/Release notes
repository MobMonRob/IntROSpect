1.0.0

    - From the menu in the right upper corner on the master list, you can set the refresh rate.


0.9.4

    - From any detail screen, you can 'hop' to another detail screen in a different category. For
      instance, on the node details page, you can click on a topic or service name and the app will
      take you to the detail page of the item you clicked. Fields with this 'hyperlink' style are
      colored light blue (but I'm thinking about making that color configurable ;-)
    - Since the above mentioned functionality may lead to building up a very long trail, the Back
      button now always brings you back to the master details page.

0.9.3

    - Now shows when the data is actually reloaded or (temporarily) not available, e.g. through
      network issues. Made some layout changes, more or less as an experiment.

0.9.2


0.9.1
